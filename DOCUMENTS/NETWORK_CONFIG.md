# NETWORK CONFIGURATION GUIDE

## QUICK SWITCH BETWEEN TESTNET AND MAINNET

XAHPAYROLL CAN BE EASILY CONFIGURED TO USE EITHER THE XRP LEDGER TESTNET OR MAINNET BY CHANGING A SINGLE ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE.

### CONFIGURATION STEPS

1. **OPEN THE FRONTEND `.ENV` FILE:**
   ```BASH
   CD FRONTEND
   NANO .ENV
   ```

2. **CHANGE THE `VITE_XRPL_NETWORK` VARIABLE:**

   **FOR MAINNET (PRODUCTION):**
   ```ENV
   VITE_XRPL_NETWORK=MAINNET
   ```

   **FOR TESTNET (DEVELOPMENT/TESTING):**
   ```ENV
   VITE_XRPL_NETWORK=TESTNET
   ```

3. **RESTART THE DEVELOPMENT SERVER:**
   ```BASH
   NPM RUN DEV
   ```

### NETWORK DETAILS

#### MAINNET
- **WEBSOCKET URL:** `WSS://XAHAU.NETWORK`
- **USE FOR:** PRODUCTION, REAL TRANSACTIONS WITH REAL XAH
- **EXPLORER:** HTTPS://EXPLORER.XAHAU.NETWORK

#### TESTNET
- **WEBSOCKET URL:** `WSS://XAHAU-TEST.NET`
- **USE FOR:** DEVELOPMENT, TESTING WITH TEST XAH
- **FAUCET:** GET FREE TEST XAH FROM THE TESTNET FAUCET
- **EXPLORER:** HTTPS://EXPLORER.XAHAU-TEST.NET

### IMPORTANT NOTES

⚠️ **BEFORE SWITCHING NETWORKS:**
- DISCONNECT ANY CONNECTED WALLETS
- CLEAR BROWSER LOCALSTORAGE IF YOU EXPERIENCE ISSUES
- ENSURE YOUR WALLET (XAMAN, CROSSMARK, GEMWALLET) IS CONFIGURED FOR THE SAME NETWORK

⚠️ **TESTNET VS MAINNET:**
- TESTNET XAH HAS **NO REAL VALUE** - IT'S FOR TESTING ONLY
- MAINNET XAH IS **REAL CRYPTOCURRENCY** WITH REAL VALUE
- NEVER USE MAINNET FOR TESTING OR DEVELOPMENT
- ALWAYS DOUBLE-CHECK WHICH NETWORK YOU'RE ON BEFORE TRANSACTIONS

### VERIFICATION

AFTER CHANGING THE NETWORK, YOU CAN VERIFY WHICH NETWORK IS ACTIVE BY:
1. CONNECTING A WALLET
2. CHECKING THE BROWSER CONSOLE LOGS - IT WILL SHOW: `XAH LEDGER CLIENT CONNECTED TO [NETWORK]`
3. VERIFYING YOUR WALLET ADDRESS ON THE APPROPRIATE EXPLORER

### DEFAULT CONFIGURATION

BY DEFAULT, XAHPAYROLL IS CONFIGURED TO USE **MAINNET** FOR PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENTS.

### ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES REFERENCE

```ENV
# BACKEND API URL
VITE_BACKEND_URL=HTTP://LOCALHOST:3001

# NETWORK CONFIGURATION
# OPTIONS: 'TESTNET' OR 'MAINNET'
VITE_XRPL_NETWORK=MAINNET
```

### TROUBLESHOOTING

**ISSUE:** WALLET WON'T CONNECT AFTER SWITCHING NETWORKS
- **SOLUTION:** DISCONNECT WALLET, CLEAR BROWSER CACHE/LOCALSTORAGE, AND RECONNECT

**ISSUE:** BALANCE SHOWS AS 0 ON TESTNET
- **SOLUTION:** FUND YOUR TESTNET ACCOUNT USING A TESTNET FAUCET

**ISSUE:** CHANGES NOT TAKING EFFECT
- **SOLUTION:** ENSURE YOU RESTARTED THE DEV SERVER AFTER CHANGING `.ENV`

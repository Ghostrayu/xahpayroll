# FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS (FAQ)

## ❓ GENERAL QUESTIONS

### WHAT IS XAH PAYROLL?
XAH PAYROLL IS A DECENTRALIZED HOURLY PAYROLL SYSTEM BUILT ON XAHAU (AN XRPL SIDECHAIN). IT ENABLES NGOS AND EMPLOYERS TO PAY WORKERS HOURLY WAGES USING PAYMENT CHANNELS WITH ESCROW PROTECTION.

### HOW DOES IT WORK?
1. **NGOS/EMPLOYERS** CREATE PAYMENT CHANNELS WITH ESCROW FUNDS
2. **WORKERS** CLOCK IN/OUT TO TRACK WORK HOURS
3. **EARNINGS** ACCUMULATE OFF-CHAIN IN THE DATABASE (NO LEDGER TRANSACTIONS)
4. **WHEN CHANNEL CLOSES**, WORKERS RECEIVE ALL ACCUMULATED EARNINGS IN A SINGLE ON-CHAIN TRANSACTION

### WHAT WALLET DO I NEED?
YOU NEED A **XAMAN WALLET** ([DOWNLOAD HERE](https://xaman.app)). XAMAN IS THE ONLY SUPPORTED WALLET FOR PRODUCTION USE.

### IS IT FREE TO USE?
YES, THE SOFTWARE IS OPEN SOURCE (MIT LICENSE). YOU ONLY PAY MINIMAL XAHAU NETWORK TRANSACTION FEES (~0.000001 XAH PER TRANSACTION).

### WHAT NETWORK DOES IT USE?
XAH PAYROLL SUPPORTS BOTH:
- **TESTNET** (FOR DEVELOPMENT AND TESTING)
- **MAINNET** (FOR PRODUCTION USE)

SEE [NETWORK_CONFIG.md](NETWORK_CONFIG.md) FOR SWITCHING INSTRUCTIONS.

- WORKER HOURLY RATE: 5 XAH/HOUR
- WORKERS CLOCK IN/OUT VIA MOBILE DEVICE
- AT PROJECT END (80 HOURS WORKED = 400 XAH EARNED)

## 🔧 TECHNICAL QUESTIONS

### CAN I RUN MY OWN INSTANCE?
YES! XAH PAYROLL IS FULLY OPEN SOURCE. SEE [QUICKSTART.md](QUICKSTART.md) FOR SELF-HOSTING INSTRUCTIONS.

### WHAT ARE THE TRANSACTION FEES?
XAHAU NETWORK FEES ARE MINIMAL:
- **PAYMENT CHANNEL CREATION**: ~0.000001 XAH
- **PAYMENT CHANNEL CLOSURE**: ~0.000001 XAH
- **TOTAL COST PER PAYMENT CYCLE**: ~0.000002 XAH (LESS THAN $0.0001 USD)

### HOW IS DATA STORED?
- **ON-CHAIN**: PAYMENT CHANNEL CREATION, CLOSURE, AND ESCROW TRANSACTIONS
- **OFF-CHAIN**: WORK HOURS, TIME TRACKING, USER PROFILES (POSTGRESQL DATABASE)
- **HYBRID APPROACH**: MINIMIZES TRANSACTION FEES WHILE MAINTAINING TRANSPARENCY

### IS IT SECURE?
YES. KEY SECURITY FEATURES:
- **NON-CUSTODIAL**: USERS CONTROL THEIR PRIVATE KEYS (XAMAN WALLET)
- **ESCROW PROTECTION**: FUNDS LOCKED ON XAHAU LEDGER UNTIL CHANNEL CLOSES
- **SETTLEDELAY PROTECTION**: WORKERS GET 24+ HOURS TO CLAIM FUNDS DURING CLOSURE
- **OPEN SOURCE**: ALL CODE IS PUBLICLY AUDITABLE

SEE [SECURITY.md](../SECURITY.md) FOR COMPLETE SECURITY POLICY.

### CAN WORKERS BE PAID IN REAL-TIME?
NO. EARNINGS ACCUMULATE IN THE DATABASE AND ARE PAID IN A **SINGLE TRANSACTION** WHEN THE PAYMENT CHANNEL CLOSES. THIS DESIGN:
- MINIMIZES TRANSACTION FEES (2 TRANSACTIONS TOTAL VS HUNDREDS)
- REDUCES NETWORK CONGESTION
- SIMPLIFIES ACCOUNTING AND RECORD-KEEPING
